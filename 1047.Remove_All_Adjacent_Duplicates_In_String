💭 Step 1: What do we need to find?
We are given a string s, and we need to remove all adjacent duplicate characters — meaning, if two same characters appear next to each other, both should be deleted.
We must continue doing this until there are no adjacent duplicates left.


🧰 Step 2: What tool (data structure) helps us handle this?
A Stack!
The stack helps us keep track of characters as we scan through the string.
If the current character is the same as the top of the stack, we pop (remove) the top — since that forms a duplicate pair.
Otherwise, we push the new character onto the stack.

🪜 Step 3: Step-by-step plan
(i) Create an empty stack of characters.
(ii) Loop through each character in the string s:
  - If the stack isn’t empty and the top of the stack equals the current character → pop it (remove the duplicate).
  - Else → push the current character onto the stack.
(iii) After the loop, the stack contains the final string with all duplicates removed.
(iv) Build the answer by concatenating all characters in the stack.
(v) Return the resulting string.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();
        
        // Step 1: Process each character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // If top of stack is same as current char → remove it
            if (!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() == s.charAt(i)) {
                st.pop();
            } else {
                // Otherwise, add current char to stack
                st.push(s.charAt(i));
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Build the final string from stack
        String ans = "";
        for (char c : st) {
            ans += c;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
