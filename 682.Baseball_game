💭 Step 1: What do we need to find?
We’re given a list of operations representing scores in a baseball game.
Each operation tells us to either add a new score or modify previous scores.
We need to compute the total sum after performing all the operations.

🧰 Step 2: What tool (data structure) helps us track previous scores?
A Stack 🧱!
We use it to keep track of valid previous scores.
When an operation depends on past scores (like “+” or “D”), we can easily access the top one or two values from the stack.

🪜 Step 3: Step-by-step plan
(i) Create an empty stack of integers to store valid scores.
(ii) Loop through each operation in the input array:

  🔹 If operation is "+" →
   - Pop the last two scores → add them together → push both back plus their sum.

  🔹 If operation is "D" →
   - Push double the top score onto the stack.

  🔹 If operation is "C" →
   - Remove (pop) the most recent score.

  🔹 Otherwise →
   - Convert the string to an integer and push it as a new score.

(iii) After processing all operations, pop everything from the stack and add to sum.
(iv) Return the final sum.

class Solution {
    public int calPoints(String[] operations) {
        int sum=0;
        Stack<Integer> s=new Stack<>();
        for(int i=0;i<operations.length;i++){
           if(operations[i].equals("+")){
                int v1=s.pop();
                int v2=s.pop();
                s.push(v2);
                s.push(v1);
                s.push(v1+v2);
            }
            else if(operations[i].equals("D")){
                s.push(s.peek()*2);
            }
            else if(operations[i].equals("C")){
                s.pop();
            }
            else{
                s.push(Integer.parseInt(operations[i]));
            }
        }
        while(!s.isEmpty()){
            sum+=s.pop();
        }
        return sum;
    }
